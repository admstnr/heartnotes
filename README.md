# Heartnotes

Personal diary app - cross-platform, offline, encrypted.

Features:

* OS X desktop app _(Windows + Linux coming soon)_
* Completely offline, password is not stored anywhere
* Rock-solid encryption (AES-256-CBC)
* Auto-save diary as you type
* Timeline view for easy access to past entries
* Export diary to readable HTML file at any time

##Â Technology

Built using React.js + Flummox + Electron.js.

### Encryption details

This uses the [SJCL library](https://crypto.stanford.edu/sjcl/) for AES-256 
encryption as well as for the PRNG algorithm to generate random seed data and 
salts.

A new encryption key is derived from the user's password as follows:

* Use Fortuna PRNG with multiple event inputs (mouse, keyboard, accelerometer etc) to generate a salt.
* Use salt and password as inputs to PBKDF2-SHA512 to generate a 512-bit key. _(The number of iterations of PBKDF2 is set such that generation takes 1 second on the user's machine- on a Macbook Air 2012 this easily results in >10000 iterations._
* Use the first 256 bits of the key with AES-256-CBC + random IV to encrypt data and store it in the diary file.
* Store the input salt and PBKDF2 iteration count in the user's diary file.

The next time the user enters the right password, we use the stored salt and 
iteration count to regenerate the right key for decryption.

## Development

**Node.js 0.12+ required.**

Setup:

```bash
$ npm install -g electron-prebuilt
$ npm install
```

Run dev server (http://localhost:3000):

```bash
$ gulp --debug
```

_NOTE: Remove `--debug` command-line argument to enable JS and CSS minification during build._



## Production build

```bash
$ gulp release
```

You will find the `Heartnotes.app` OS X executable in `build-electron/relese/...`
