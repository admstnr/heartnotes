Authorities said the shooting came after a six-minute struggle in the parking lot of the Treehouse Apartments in Alamo Heights, where Redus lived.  A toxicology test also showed Redus had a blood alcohol content of .155, nearly twice the legal limit to drive, when authorities say he fought UIW officer Christopher Carter on Dec. 6 in the parking lot of Redus' off-campus apartment complex near Incarnate Word.  The Dec. 7 autopsy conducted by Dr. Elizabeth Peacock found that five bullets had struck Redus in the left eye, upper chest, left elbow, right hip and upper back. The report didn't say which wounds came first, but it concluded that the shot to the back was the \u201cmost immediately lethal.\u201d  At a past press conference, Alamo Heights Police Chief Richard Pruitt said Carter was driving on Broadway in a marked UIW police pickup truck when he spotted another truck being driven erratically. It was in the early morning hours of Dec. 6, and Carter saw the truck strike a curb and swerve briefly into the oncoming lanes.  Carter followed the suspected drunken driver. He was outside his jurisdiction, but Carter was a licensed peace officer authorized to arrest DWI suspects anywhere in Texas.  The officer followed Redus and activated the emergency lights of his police truck near the Treehouse Apartments, where Redus parked and got out of his vehicle.  The dash cam of Carter's truck didn't record video of the altercation, but Carter was wearing a microphone that recorded audio. Pruitt said the recording captured Carter asking Redus to stop and put his hands on the truck. Redus complied, but began to struggle when Carter started to handcuff him, Pruitt said.  During the six-minute confrontation, Carter told Redus 14 times to put his hands behind his back and told him three times that he was under arrest, Pruitt said. Carter told Redus to stop resisting 56 times, Pruitt said.  Redus at one point grabbed Carter's police baton and struck the officer with it, authorities said.  Carter regained control of the baton and Redus broke free. Pruitt said Carter drew his handgun, ordered Redus to stop, and Redus charged him with his hand raised. Carter fired six times.  \u2022 http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/local/article/UIW-Student-slain-by-campus-officer-was-5525223.php \u2022 http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/local/article/Autopsy-UIW-student-shot-in-the-back-5335693.php \u2022 http://www.expressnews.com/news/local/article/Witness-UIW-student-fought-officer-before-fatal-5077162.php#/0", "officer_names": "Cpl.

Fabian Garza, 21, was driving a 1994 Cadillac El Dorado that rear-ended a white SUV early Friday in the drive-through of Chacho's, in the 8600 block of Perrin Beitel Road on the Northeast Side.  Garza tried to back up and leave the scene of the 1 a.m. wreck, according to police. The SUV's driver, whose identity is unknown, \u201cexchanged words\u201d with the people in the Cadillac and left the scene, according to police.  A witness told Officer Robert Encina of the San Antonio Police Department about the incident and added . Encina was in full uniform working an off-duty security job at the restaurant, of the incident, adding that the people in the Cadillac seemed intoxicated.  The witness said the officer repeatedly asked Garza to turn off the car and step outside the car. Garza and his passenger Marquise Jones, 23, were not following Encina's orders and Jones seemed to be reaching for something in the car, the witness told police.  Encina was able to turn off the car himself, and put the keys on the roof while trying to handcuff Garza, according to police.  At that point, police said Jones got out of the passenger door and pulled a revolver from the area of his waist, turning to look at Encina.  The witness said Encina then fired shots.  Jones started to run westward before collapsing, according to the police report.  An arriving officer found Jones lying face down toward Perrin Beitel road with a gunshot wound on the left side of his back. He was not breathing and was pronounced dead within minutes, according to police.  \u2022 http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/local/article/Man-jailed-in-incident-that-led-to-fatal-shooting-5290557.php \u2022 http://www.expressnews.com/news/local/article/Lawsuit-Cop-targeted-minorities-in-incident-5405382.php \u2022 http://www.kens5.com/story/news/local/2014/06/27/10664486/ \u2022 http://www.kens5.com/story/news/local/2014/06/27/10664384/ \u2022 http://www.sanantonio.gov/Commpa/News/TabId/317/ArtMID/1970/ArticleID/1445/Councilwoman-Taylor-Releases-Statement-on-Chacho%E2%80%99s-Shooting-Incident.aspx", "officer_names": "Officer Robert Encina"}, {"incident_date": null, "city": "Elizabeth", "searched_date": "2014-06-29", "victim_age": 44, "shots_fired": 1, "weapon": "knife or cutting instrument", "victim_race": "unknown", "agency": "Elizabeth Police Department", "county": "Union", "source_url": "http://www.nj.com/union/index.ssf/2014/06/elizabeth_man_shot_by_police_was_threatening_woman_with_knife_authorities_say.html", "victim_armed": "armed", "victim_name": "John Omar Delvalle", "state": "NJ", "shootings": "yes", "victim_gender": "male", "outcome": "killed", "summary": "Officers were called to the scene of a domestic dispute where the suspect was holding a woman at knife point.
